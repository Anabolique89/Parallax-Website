          Roses are out of this world — literally! The very first rose to
          travel to space was named Overnight Scentsation. The play on
          its name had to do with the fact that researchers were bringing
          the miniature rose to space to learn how low gravity impacted a
          rose’s scent.

          People in 15th century England lived through the “War of Roses.”
          The war got its name after roses were used to symbolize which side
          people supported or were fighting for. White roses symbolized
          Yorkshire and red roses symbolized Lancaster.

      <h2>Black roses are an illusion of the mind</h2>
      <p>
        There are no roses that are black in color,
        although there are a few species of roses that
        come close. The Turkish Halfeti rose, also known
        as “The Black Rose of Turkey”, is an extremely
        rare breed that appears pitch-black to the eye,
        but in fact is a dark reddish-crimson color.

      <h2>The world’s first blue rose
</h2>

        <p>
          For years breeders have crossed different colors of roses
          in an effort to create what seemed the impossible, a blue
          rose. Rose petals lack the enzyme needed to create a blue
          pigment and breeders always failed. However, in 2009,
          applying genetic engineering resulted in the world’s
          first blue rose.</p>

      <h3>The healing powers of the rose</h3>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>
          Roses are not just some beautiful flower;
          each one contains some very beneficial gives
          from nature. Just below the blooms, around the
          area where the flower protrudes from the stem,
          are some curved leaves, commonly known as rosehips.
          These tiny leaves contain more vitamin C than any
          fruit or vegetable grown for that purpose today.

          By brewing them in a strong tea, one cup will
          grant you an amount equal to five glasses of orange
          juice. The petals of cells are also edible, and
          some varieties have flavours that mimic delicious
          fruits, like strawberries, cherries, plums and peaches.
          Another reason for its popularity is most likely because
          of its longevity, one that will last long with very little
          care, for days after it is received.
